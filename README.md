# github-diff-bug

This is a very long sentence that is being used to prove a point about PRs and whitespaces. If I add a ton of white spaces at the end of this line, and then remove it in another branch, the resulting PR will have overlapping diff colors. The issue is probably more noticible on smaller screens and shrunk browser windows.
